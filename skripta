Sure, here is a simple script that splits Polish words into syllables:

Copy code
def split_syllables(word):
    # List of vowel sounds
    vowels = ['a', 'ą', 'e', 'ę', 'i', 'o', 'ó', 'u', 'y']
    syllables = []
    current_syllable = ""
    for letter in word:
        current_syllable += letter
        if letter in vowels:
            syllables.append(current_syllable)
            current_syllable = ""
    if current_syllable:
        syllables.append(current_syllable)
    return syllables

# Example usage
print(split_syllables("słońce"))  # Output: ['sło', 'ńce']
This script uses a simple approach where a syllable is defined as a sequence of letters that starts with a vowel sound and ends with a consonant sound. It iterates through the letters of the word and adds each letter to the current syllable until it encounters a vowel. At that point, it appends the current syllable to the list of syllables and starts a new syllable. Finally, it checks if there is a syllable that was not added to the list, and if so, it adds it to the list.

Note that this is a very basic approach and may not work for all words in the Polish language. For example, it does not handle words with multiple consecutive vowels or consonants, or words with syllable boundary patterns that are not captured by this simple approach.
